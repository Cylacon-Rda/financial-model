## How to Use

### Starting Out

When you first open the app, you'll see default values already filled in. These are example numbers to help you understand the model.

### Entering Your Numbers

1. **Startup Capital (RWF)**
   - How much money you're starting with
   - Example: RWF 50,000,000 (50 million francs)

2. **Patients per Month (Year 1)**
   - How many patients you expect in your first year
   - Be realistic! Start small and grow
   - Example: 10 patients/month

3. **Annual Patient Growth Rate (%)**
   - How much you expect patient numbers to grow each year
   - Example: 50% means you'll have 50% more patients each year
   - Conservative: 20-30%, Aggressive: 50%+

4. **Average Service Fee per Patient (RWF)**
   - How much each patient pays on average
   - Example: RWF 500,000

5. **Accommodation/Travel Commission Rate (%)**
   - What percentage you earn from hotel/travel bookings
   - Example: 15% means if a patient spends RWF 1,000,000 on accommodation, you earn RWF 150,000

6. **Monthly Marketing Cost (RWF)**
   - How much you spend each month on marketing
   - Includes ads, promotions, social media
   - Example: RWF 2,000,000/month

7. **Monthly Operating Costs (RWF)**

   - Example: RWF 3,000,000/month

8. **Corporate Tax Rate (%)**
   - Tax on profits (Rwanda default: 28%)
   - Only ask an accountant if you need a different rate

### Understanding the Results

#### Key Metrics Card

- **Break-Even Point**: When you'll make back your initial investment
  - "12 months" means you'll recover costs in 1 year
  - "Not Reached" means costs are too high or revenue too low

- **Cash Runway**: How long your money will last
  - "24 months" means you have 2 years before running out
  - "Infinite" means you're profitable from the start (great!)

- **Total Revenue (5Y)**: All money earned over 5 years
- **Total Net Income (5Y)**: Actual profit after all costs and taxes

#### Financial Trends Charts

Two bar charts show:
1. **Revenue Growth**: Is revenue increasing each year? (Good!)
2. **Cash Balance**: Do you have money left? (Should be positive and growing)

#### Income Statement

This shows:
- How much money you're making (Revenue)
- How much you're spending (Expenses)
- Your profit or loss (Net Income)

Look for:
- Green numbers = Profit (good!)
- Red numbers = Loss (need to adjust your model)
- Revenue should grow each year
- Ideally, profits appear by Year 2 or 3

#### Cash Flow Statement

This shows:
- Cash at the start of each year
- Cash earned or lost during the year
- Cash at the end of the year

Your ending cash should:
- Always be positive
- Grow over time
- If it goes negative, you'll run out of money!

#### Balance Sheet

This shows:
- **Assets**: What you own (mostly cash)
- **Liabilities**: What you owe (zero in this model)
- **Equity**: Owner's stake in the business

Equity should grow if you're profitable.

### Saving Your Model

Click the "Save Model" button at the bottom of the input form. You'll see a green message confirming the save.

The app automatically loads your last saved model when you return.

### Testing Different Scenarios

Try creating different models:

**Optimistic Scenario**
- Higher patient numbers
- Higher growth rate
- Lower costs

**Conservative Scenario**
- Lower patient numbers
- Lower growth rate
- Higher costs

**Realistic Scenario**
- Most likely numbers based on market research

## Common Questions

### What if my numbers show losses?

That's normal for startups! Most businesses lose money in the first 1-2 years. Look at:
1. When do you become profitable?
2. Do you have enough cash to last until then?
3. Can you reduce costs or increase revenue?

### How do I know if my model is good?

A healthy model shows:
- Break-even within 12-24 months
- Positive cash for at least 18 months
- Growing revenue year-over-year
- Improving profit margins over time

### What growth rate should I use?

- **Conservative**: 20-30% per year
- **Moderate**: 40-50% per year
- **Aggressive**: 60%+ per year

Medical tourism is growing in East Africa, but be realistic based on your marketing budget and capacity.

### What if I don't know exact numbers?

Start with educated guesses:
1. Research similar businesses
2. Talk to potential partners about commission rates
3. Get quotes for marketing and operating costs
4. Start conservative and adjust as you learn more

## Tips for Success

1. **Be Conservative**: Better to exceed expectations than fall short
2. **Update Regularly**: Revise your model as you learn more
3. **Show Multiple Scenarios**: Investors like to see you've thought through different outcomes
4. **Focus on Break-Even**: When do you stop losing money? That's crucial.
5. **Track Cash**: Profitability is great, but cash keeps you alive

## Using This for Funding

When presenting to investors or incubators:

1. **Show your assumptions clearly**: They'll judge if these are realistic
2. **Explain your revenue model**: Why will patients choose MedGate?
3. **Justify your costs**: Why do you need this much for marketing/operations?
4. **Show path to profitability**: When will you make money?
5. **Demonstrate growth potential**: How big can this become?

## Red Flags to Avoid

- Never running out of cash (check Cash Runway)
- Break-even too far away (>36 months is risky)
- Unrealistic growth (100%+ annually is hard to sustain)
- Costs too low (you need resources to grow)
- Revenue assumptions without justification

## Getting Help

If you're unsure about your model:
- Consult with a financial advisor
- Talk to other startup founders
- Present to incubator mentors
- Test assumptions with potential customers

## Rwanda-Specific Notes

- Corporate tax is 28% for companies
- Consider VAT implications (not in this model)
- Medical tourism is growing in East Africa
- Rwanda is positioning as regional healthcare hub
- Consider regional expansion to Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania

## Next Steps

After creating your model:
1. Validate assumptions with market research
2. Test with potential customers and partners
3. Refine based on feedback
4. Use for investor presentations
5. Update quarterly as business develops
